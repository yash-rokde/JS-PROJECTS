# Color Palette Picker

This is a basic JavaScript project that allows users to dynamically generate a color palette and interact with it. The application provides the following features:

## Features

1. **Dynamic Color Generation**:

   - The application generates a set of color boxes dynamically, each displaying a unique color.

2. **Hex Color Code Display**:
   - When a user clicks on a color box, the respective hex color code of the selected color is displayed.

## How It Works

- The project uses JavaScript to create and manage the color palette dynamically.
- Each color box is assigned a random color, and the corresponding hex code is stored.
- Clicking on a color box triggers an event that retrieves and displays the hex code of the selected color.

## Usage

1. Open the project in a browser.
2. Click the "Generate Colors" button (if available) to create a new palette.
3. Click on any color box to view its hex color code.

This project is a simple and interactive way to explore color palettes and learn about hex color codes.
